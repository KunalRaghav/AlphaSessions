## Python

### Installation

We'll be using the `open source` [Anacoda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to install python on our machines.

Anacoda is used because it contains all the basic packages required for ML/AI and data science by default which saves effort in the long run.

## Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) i.e. it helps people track changes on specific files. Github is a corporate company that provides hosting using git.

In simpler terms it saves effort from making multiple copies of the same file with slight alterations.

i.e.
